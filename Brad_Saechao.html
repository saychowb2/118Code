    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>I am a current senior at SJSU majoring in MIS. I will graduate Fall 2021 with a Bachelors degree in Management Information Systems (MIS).
        <br> I got interested in this degree because coding has made me curious and fascinated. I interned at LinkedIn as a Product Operations Manager 
        <br> from February 2019 to July 2019. I love to go camping, and fishing. </p>

    <p>This lecture video is about what cookies are and what Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is. The video showed an example of a HTTP request 
        <br> message which includes the method, URL version and header fields. The video also shows error codes, for example 404 = Not found,
<br> 400 = bad request, 200 = OK, and 505 = HTTP version not supported. Some improvements to the video I would suggest is that try to have the
<br> video a bit more concise. 30 minutes seems quite long and lost me. Possibly break it up into three different videos since 10 minutes isn't too long.</p>
